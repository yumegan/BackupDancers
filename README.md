# BackupDancers

## Inspiration
As a dancer, choreographing and blocking can be hard when you're by yourself. It can be difficult to visualize what different formations might look like. Therefore, I decided to create the Backup Dancers lens to help dancers visualize what their choreography could look like in different formations.

## What it does
The Backup Dancers lens illustrates what different formations with different numbers of dancers may look like. The user can choose to have one to four backup dancers and choose between three common formations (pyramid, horizontal line, vertical line).
